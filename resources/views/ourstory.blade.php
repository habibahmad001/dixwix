                <p>Dix and Wix were childhood friends who grew up in the same neighborhood, went to the same school, and shared everything—from books and toys to ideas and experiences. Their collaboration continued into college, where they lent each other sports equipment and supported each other through their studies.</p>

                <p>As life unfolded, they found themselves working in the same city, buying homes in the same neighborhood, and—just like old times—sharing tools for various home projects. One day, they had an idea: What if there were an easier way to share unused items, collaborate on projects, and exchange expertise with trusted friends and neighbors?</p>

                <p>That idea became DixWix.com—a private peer rental platform where Dix represents the lender and Wix represents the borrower. Built on trust, convenience, and a shared history, the platform empowers communities to lend, borrow and collaborate.</p>

                <p>Today, Dix and Wix are married with kids and still share a lot of things — except, of course, their college adventures & stories with their spouses !!</p>

                <p>Welcome to DixWix.com! We’re excited for you to create your own story of sharing, collaboration, and community experience.</p>
